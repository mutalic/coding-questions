# Debouncing / Throttling

Debouncing and throttling are both methods that increase performance and reduce cost by either delaying the invocation of a function or by setting a minimum wait time before the function can be re-invoked.

While it is important to understand the concept and usage of both methods, when applying these methods in actual projects, using JavaScript utility libraries such as _Underscore.js_ or _Lodash_ is recommended.
